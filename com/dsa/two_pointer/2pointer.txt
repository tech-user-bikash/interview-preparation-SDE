- two pointers or sliding window templates are below:
1. Constant Window:
   Ex: A = [-1,2,3,4,5,-2], K = 4 (no of total element for each time).
   Find the max sum for given size of window.

2. Longest sub-array or substring where <condition>
   Ex: Longest Sub-array with sum <= K. A=[2,5,1,7,0], K = 14

3. No of sub-array's where <condition>.
